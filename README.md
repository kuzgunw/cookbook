🍳 Kuzgun Cookbook
Welcome to Kuzgun Cookbook! 🦅

This is my very first project created as part of The Odin Project Foundations. It’s a simple, clean recipe website where I practiced the fundamentals of HTML, such as structuring content, using lists, and working with links and images.

The Journey Begins:

🌱 This is officially my #1 project.

🚀 My goal is to keep building, keep learning, and get better with every single line of code.

📈 I’m committed to evolving my skills step-by-step, aiming for more complex and beautiful projects as I progress through the curriculum.
